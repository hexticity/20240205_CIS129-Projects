print('In the heart of the enchanted forest, a mischievous squirrel named Spark found a forgotten chest filled with acorns that granted wishes.')
print('Word spread among the woodland creatures, and soon they gathered to make their desires known.')
print('Spark, being a true trickster, secretly wished for a never-ending supply of the crunchiest nuts.')
print('Little did he know, the magic acorns had a sense of humor â€“ the next morning, the entire forest floor was covered in acorns, creating a nutty wonderland that brought laughter to all, especially Spark!')
